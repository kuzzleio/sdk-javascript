# login

Login a user using a specified strategy and their credentials.

If the Kuzzle response contains a JWT Token, the Kuzzle SDK token is set and the `loginAttempt` event is fired immediately with the following object:
`{ success: true }`
This is the case, for instance, with the `local` authentication strategy.

If the request succeeds but there is no token, then it means that the chosen strategy is a two-steps authentication method, such as the OAUTH strategy. In that case, the `loginAttempt` event is **not** fired. To complete the login, the `setJwtToken` method must be called either with a token or with an appropriate Kuzzle response.

If the login attempt fails, the `loginAttempt` event is fired with the following response:
`{ success: false, error: 'error message' }`

<div class="alert alert-info">
This method is non-queuable, meaning that during offline mode, it will be discarded and the callback will be called with an error. [Learn more.](/core/1/guides/essentials/user-authentication#local-strategy)

## login(strategy, [credentials], [expiresIn], [callback])

| Arguments     | Type        | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `strategy`    | string      | Authentication strategy (local, facebook, github, ...) |
| `credentials` | JSON object | Optional login credentials, depending on the strategy  |
| `expiresIn`   | _varies_    | Login expiration time                                  |
| `callback`    | function    | Optional callback handling the response                |

**Note:** If the `expiresIn` argument is not set, the default token expiration value will be taken from the Kuzzle server configuration.

By default, Kuzzle comes with the [kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-local](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-local) plugin, which provides the `local` authentication strategy.
This strategy requires a `username` and `password` as `credentials`
