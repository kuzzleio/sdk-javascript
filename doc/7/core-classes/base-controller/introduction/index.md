# BaseController

Base class for a [custom SDK controller](/sdk/js/7/essentials/extend-sdk/custom-controller#define-a-custom-sdk-controller).

Custom SDK controllers have to extend the `BaseController` class to be added with the [Kuzzle.useController](/sdk/js/7/core-classes/kuzzle/use-controller) method.
