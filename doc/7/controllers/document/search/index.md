# search

Searches documents.

There is a limit to how many documents can be returned by a single search query.
That limit is by default set at 10000 documents, and you can't get over it even with the from and size pagination options.

Once a `SearchResult` has been retrieved, navigation through pages can be done with the [SearchResult.next](/sdk/js/7/core-classes/search-result/next) method.

:::info
When processing a large number of documents (i.e. more than 1000), it is advised to paginate the results using [SearchResult.next](/sdk/js/7/core-classes/search-result/next) rather than increasing the size parameter.
:::

::: warning
When using a cursor with the `scroll` option, Elasticsearch has to duplicate the transaction log to keep the same result during the entire scroll session.
It can lead to memory leaks if a scroll duration too great is provided, or if too many scroll sessions are open simultaneously.

This method also supports the [Koncorde Filters DSL](/core/2/api/koncorde-filters-syntax) to match documents by passing the `lang` argument with the value `koncorde`.
Koncorde filters will be translated into an Elasticsearch query.

#### verb

When instantiated with a HTTP protocol object, the SDK uses the POST API by default for this API route.
You can set the `verb` option to `GET` to force the SDK to use the GET API instead.

## Body properties

### Optional:

- `query`: the search query itself, using the [ElasticSearch Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/query-dsl.html) or the [Koncorde Filters DSL](/core/2/api/koncorde-filters-syntax) syntax.
- `aggregations`: control how the search results should be [aggregated](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/search-aggregations.html)
- `sort`: contains a list of fields, used to [sort search results](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/search-request-sort.html), in order of importance.

An empty body matches all documents in the queried collection.

## Resolves

Resolves to a [SearchResult](/sdk/js/7/core-classes/search-result/properties) object.
