# WebSocket

Inherits from: [KuzzleEventEmitter](/sdk/js/7/core-classes/kuzzle-event-emitter)

The WebSocket protocol can be used by an instance of the SDK to communicate with your Kuzzle server.

This protocol allows you to use all the features of Kuzzle, including [real-time notifications](/sdk/js/7/essentials/realtime-notifications).
