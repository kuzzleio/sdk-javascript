# Getting Started with Kuzzle and ReactJS

This tutorial will help you get started with **Kuzzle V2** (+ **Javascript SDK 7**) and **ReactJS**. We will create **documents** in Kuzzle and subscribe to
[document notifications](/sdk/js/7/essentials/realtime-notifications#document-messages) to develop a realtime chat.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 12.0.0 ([install here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- **Create React App** ([install here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))
- **Running Kuzzle V2 Stack** ([instructions here](/core/2/guides/getting-started/run-kuzzle))

## Prepare your environment

Create your React app and install all the dependencies from the command line using npm:
```bash
npx create-react-app kuzzle-playground
```
Install Kuzzle's Javascript SDK: 
```bash
cd kuzzle-playground
npm install kuzzle-sdk@7
```

We'll rewrite the *src/App.js* so you can remove everything inside.

## Instantiating Kuzzle SDK

We have to connect the server so that our client can interact with it.
To achieve this, create a *src/services/kuzzle.js* file to put our kuzzle instance declaration:

<<< ./snippets/kuzzle.js.snippet[js]

You can now edit the *src/App.js* file to connect to Kuzzle. To do this, add the following imports at the top of the file:

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:1[js]

Now, define the `App` class. The constructor must add a `message` property in the state (we'll use it to store the user input message) a `username` property, `messages` property (weâ€™ll use it to store all messages) and a `validate` property (Value that will change the display):

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:2[js]

Then we will establish the connection to kuzzle and create the index and collection of our chat if they don't exist. Once connection is established, we need to ensure our Kuzzle instance is properly initialized before we allow the user to interact with it. We implement this logic in the the following `valid()` method in the App Component:

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:3[js]

## Get the username

First of all, we need to know the user's name, this function will return the input allowing the user to enter his or her name. Let's add this one.

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:4[js]

As you can see we'll need the `handleInputChange()` function to save the `username` variable

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:5[js]

## Display the messages

Then, create the following functions to fetch and display the messages:

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:6[js]

The `fetchMessage()` function will [search](/sdk/js/7/controllers/document/search) for the first hundred newest messages and store them in our array. We called it in the `valid()` function we created above.

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:7[js]

Now, add the following function outside the App component to display the messages:

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:8[js]

## Send messages

We need to write a simple method that will [create](/sdk/js/7/controllers/document/create) a new message document in Kuzzle.

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:9[js]

We will receive real-time notifications from Kuzzle each time a message is added to our message collection.
We will use those notifications to append the messages to our application state.

Now, we need to subscribe to the collection that contains our messages. So let's create our `subscribeMessages()` method. It will call Kuzzle's realtime controller to allow us to [receive notifications](/sdk/js/7/controllers/realtime/subscribe) on message creations:

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:10[js]

Add an input field bound to the message property, and a button which calls our `sendMessage()` function:

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:11[js]

Add the following CSS classes in the *src/App.css* file:

<<< ./snippets/App.css.snippet[js]

Finally, add the `render()` method of our App component:

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet:12[js]

The entire file should look like this:

<<< ./snippets/App.js.snippet[js]

To launch this app, just type the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

You can now send new messages to Kuzzle and receive the notifications of messages creation to update your state and display the new messages.
