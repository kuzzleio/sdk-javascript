# getAutoRefresh

This action returns the current autorefresh status of a index.

Each index has an autorefresh flag.
When set to true, each write request triggers a [refresh](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/docs-refresh.html) action in Elasticsearch.
Without a refresh after a write request, the documents may not be immediately visible in search.

:::info
A refresh operation comes with some performance costs.
While forcing the autoRefresh can be convenient on a development or test environment,
we recommend that you avoid using it in production or at least carefully monitor its implications before using it.
