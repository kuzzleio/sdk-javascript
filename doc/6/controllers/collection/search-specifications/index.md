# searchSpecifications



Searches collection specifications.

There is a limit to how many items can be returned by a single search query.
That limit is by default set at 10000, and you can't get over it even with the from and size pagination options.

:::info
When processing a large number of items (i.e. more than 1000), it is advised to paginate the results using [SearchResult.next](/sdk/js/6/core-classes/search-result/next) rather than increasing the size parameter.

```js
searchSpecifications([body], [options]);
```

| Arguments | Type              | Description                           |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `body`    | <pre>object</pre> | An object containing the search query |
| `options` | <pre>object</pre> | Query options                         |

### body

The body is a set of filters using [Elasticsearch Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/search-request-body.html) to match the documents you are looking for.
The filters must be inside the `query` property of the body.

Example:

```js
const body = {
  query: {
    match_all: {
      boost: 1
    }
  }
};
```

### options

| Arguments  | Type                            | Description                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `queuable` | <pre>boolean</pre><br/>(`true`) | Make this request queuable or not    |
| `from`     | <pre>number</pre><br/>(`0`)     | Offset of the first document         |
| `size`     | <pre>number</pre><br/>(`10`)    | Maximum number of documents returned |
| `scroll`   | <pre>string</pre><br/>          | Maximum duration for scroll session  |

- `size` controls the maximum number of documents returned in the response
- `from` is usually used with the `size` argument, and defines the offset from the first result you want to fetch
- `scroll` is used to fetch large result sets, and it must be set with a [time duration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/common-options.html#time-units). If set, a forward-only cursor will be created (and automatically destroyed at the end of the set duration), and its identifier will be returned in the `scrollId` property, along with the first page of the results.
