# Events

An event system allows to be notified when the SDK status changes. These events are issued by the [Kuzzle](/sdk/js/6/core-classes/kuzzle) SDK object.

The API for interacting with events is described by our [KuzzleEventEmitter](/sdk/js/6/core-classes/kuzzle-event-emitter) class documentation.

**Note:** listeners are called in the order of their insertion.
