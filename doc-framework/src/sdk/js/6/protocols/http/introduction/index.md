# Http

The Http protocol can be used by an instance of the SDK to communicate with your Kuzzle server.

:::info
This protocol does not allow to use the [real-time notifications](/sdk/js/6/essentials/realtime-notifications/).

If you need real-time features, then you have to use either [WebSocket](/sdk/js/6/protocols/websocket) or [SocketIO](/sdk/js/6/protocols/socketio) protocols.
